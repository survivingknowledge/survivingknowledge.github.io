Did you ever had that nagging feeling of xyz is great but why don't they add/change such and such feature to make it 10x more usable? Or another one I love is, why it is taking so long for them to build it? I understand bit and pieces from what I have cobbled together throughout my venture into the php world but none ever answered the question of how to build enterprise class software. I have read dozens and dozens of books, built tutorials on the web would hit a literal brick wall when a feature I wanted to develop got more complicated and had to resort to cryptic language documentation with terrible examples for people that don't already use the feature. 

It became a scavenger hunt. Then to make matters worse I was tired of my current job and would much prefer one working with fellow developers so I looked into becoming a professional developer. Then came what I like to call alphabet soup. You talk to one group of people and they say, why do you still write procedural php, OO is the holy grail. But you can't stop there you need to speed up your development by using a framework. Then for php you got your choices of wordpress, drupal, codeigniter, laravel, zend and all the different flavors of shopping cart software, all of which are different! But that only covers the small portion of the back end. As a single developer/freelancer you also have to learn front-end technologies to make things look good. CSS3 was no longer good enough and now SASS and LESS are popular with more switching to postcss type build. Then you write you javascript and have some simple addons such as jquery to do animations, click handling and ajax. But you need to be writting js in es2015 which doesn't work in any browser except chrome so you have to transpile it into useable code for the other browsers with programs like babel. 

Then you need to get a build system up and running to further speed up development thus you need to learn a task runner such as gulp (new kid on block) and grunt (omg the configuration). You set up and figet with gulp tasks and start hunting for gulp packages to do certain things along with live reload to run your server when developing or use some kit like webpack. Then comes the era of we must make everything in javascript. Queue in nodejs, react, angular, ember, flux and others. 

So you get alphabet soup
HTML5, CSS3, SASS, LESS, POSTCSS, PHP, JS, ES2015, NODEJS, REACT, ANGULAR/2, EMBER
CODEIGNITER, WORDPRESS, GULP, GRUNT, BOWER (package manager), BROWSERFY, LIVERELOAD, JQUERY,
RANDOM SHOPPING CART (X-CART, BIGCOMMERENCE, ESCOMMERCE, MAGNETO)

Eventually I'll learn all of these. For now I'm learning more indepth about ruby and working my way through sinatra and fixing to hit rails land. Its frustrating to have things to learn continually tacked on when you haven't finshed learning all the tools before it but as long as it lets me create. I'll just keep chugging along.
